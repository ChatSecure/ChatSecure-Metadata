What's new in v4.0.7:

* Fix issue receiving short OMEMO messages from users of the Conversations app
* Partially fix issue where invalid OMEMO bundles are published
* Deadlock detector: If the app is frozen, please wait ~20 seconds for it to crash, then relaunch and submit a crash report.
* Remove Dukgo from server list because their server will be shutting down soon. See https://twitter.com/cfarivar/status/852193164207063040
* Add additional public community servers to list. Full list here: https://github.com/ChatSecure/xmpp-server-list
* home.zom.im is now the default server for new account registrations
* Adding/removing contacts while temporarily disconnected is more reliable
* Update Catalan translation

What's new in v4.0.6:

* Fix crash affecting iOS 8 & 9 devices

What's new in v4.0.5:

* Shows notifications for incoming requests and outgoing approvals
* Displays idle status / last activity in the title bar, for instance "Active 10 min ago".  This keeps track of the last time you interact with the app, and will report this value when queried by your contacts. The time you last interacted with the app is identical for all of your accounts, so broadcasting this value is disabled for Tor accounts and when auto-login disabled.
* Fixes a crash when viewing your account details on iOS 8 devices
* Fix issues with contacts that get stuck as "Pending Approval"
