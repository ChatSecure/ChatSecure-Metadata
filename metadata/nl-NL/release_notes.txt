What's new in v4.0.6:

* Fix crash affecting iOS 8 & 9 devices

What's new in v4.0.5:

* Shows notifications for incoming requests and outgoing approvals
* Displays idle status / last activity in the title bar, for instance "Active 10 min ago".  This keeps track of the last time you interact with the app, and will report this value when queried by your contacts. The time you last interacted with the app is identical for all of your accounts, so broadcasting this value is disabled for Tor accounts and when auto-login disabled.
* Fixes a crash when viewing your account details on iOS 8 devices
* Fix issues with contacts that get stuck as "Pending Approval"
