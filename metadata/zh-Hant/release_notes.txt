# What's new in 4.1.0
* XEP-0363: HTTP Upload support for much faster and reliable media messaging. [1]
* XEP-0352: Client State Indication. Helps reduce network usage when running in the background.
* End-to-end encryption for file transfers in OMEMO or OTR sessions [2].
* Inline media previews for incoming URLs. (Optional)
* Bug fixes and refactoring.
* Tor 0.3.0.9

# Caveats
* Your server administrator must enable support for XEP-0363. See mod_http_upload for Prosody [3] and ejabberd [4] for more details.
* Encrypted file transfer is required in OMEMO/OTR, but has limited compatibility for receiving clients. Users on the other end will receive `aesgcm://` links [2].
* Inline media previews are enabled by default, but can be disabled on a per-account basis. This feature should be disabled if you have extreme privacy concerns or do not trust your contacts. This setting is always disabled for Tor accounts.
